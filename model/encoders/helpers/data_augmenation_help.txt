Below is a recipe for more realistic lip‐reading augmentations, based on what’s commonly used in recent VSR papers (e.g. Petridis et al. ICASSP’20, Ma et al. Interspeech’21). The idea is to split your transforms into a “train” set (with strong stochastic augmentations) and a “val/test” set (deterministic crops), for example:

import torchvision.transforms as T

# constants – these should match the mean/std you computed over your train set
MEAN = 0.41923218965530395
STD  = 0.13392585515975952

# 1) TRAIN‐time augmentations
train_transforms = T.Compose([
    # your frames are already grayscale L mode, so no need for Grayscale()
    T.RandomCrop(88),                    # random 88×88 patch from the 96×96 ROI
    T.RandomHorizontalFlip(p=0.5),       # mirror left/right
    T.RandomRotation(degrees=5),         # small in‐plane rotations
    T.ColorJitter(brightness=0.2,        # small contrast/brightness changes
                  contrast=0.2),
    T.ToTensor(),                        # PIL→C×H×W, float∈[0..1]
    T.Normalize(mean=[MEAN],             # normalize the single‐channel to zero‐mean/unit‐std
                std=[STD]),
    # optionally, you can also add:
    # T.RandomErasing(p=0.3,
    #                 scale=(0.02, 0.15),
    #                 ratio=(0.3, 3.3),
    #                 value='random'),
])

# 2) VAL / TEST‐time “centered” transforms
val_test_transforms = T.Compose([
    T.CenterCrop(88),                    # the same 88×88 patch, deterministically
    T.ToTensor(),
    T.Normalize(mean=[MEAN],
                std=[STD]),
])
Then in your VideoDataset you can pass transform=train_transforms for the training split, and transform=val_test_transforms for both validation and test splits.

Why these augmentations?

Random crop & horizontal flip simulate small shifts and mirror‐symmetry of the ROI.
Tiny rotations/ColorJitter mimic head‐pose small tilts and lighting variability.
RandomErasing (if you enable it) can help the model to be robust to partial occlusions.
This strategy is almost identical to what you’ll find in Ma et al. (“End‑to‑end Audio‑Visual Speech Recognition with Conformers”, Interspeech 2021) and in Petridis et al. (“Lipreading using Temporal Convolutional Networks”, ICASSP 2020).

augmenatinos when applied on a video will apply on all of its frames correctly this way?

The short answer is: No, if you do

for frame in frames:
    frame = train_transforms(frame)
then each call to e.g. RandomCrop, RandomHorizontalFlip or RandomRotation will sample new random parameters for that single frame, and you will end up with incoherent augmentations across the video (different crops/flip/rotations etc. on each frame).

In lip‑reading (and almost every video task) you almost always want to apply exactly the same spatial transform to every frame of a clip so that your mouth doesn’t “jump around” from frame to frame. You can achieve that in two ways:

Group / Video‐level Transforms
Write a little wrapper that:

a) Takes the list (or tensor) of all your PIL or torch frames
b) Samples the random parameters once (e.g. a crop box, a flip decision, a rotation angle, etc.)
c) Applies that same operation to each frame in turn

Here’s a minimal example of a VideoRandomCrop + VideoRandomHorizontalFlip + ToTensor + Normalize pipeline:

import random
from torchvision.transforms import functional as F

class VideoAugmentations:
    def __init__(self, crop_size=(88,88),
                 mean=0.41923218965530395,
                 std=0.13392585515975952,
                 p_flip=0.5,
                 max_rotate=5):
        self.crop_size = crop_size
        self.mean, self.std = mean, std
        self.p_flip = p_flip
        self.max_rotate = max_rotate

    def __call__(self, pil_frames):
        # 1) pick one random crop location
        i, j, h, w = F.get_params(pil_frames[0], output_size=self.crop_size)
        # 2) decide flip or not
        do_flip = random.random() < self.p_flip
        # 3) pick one random rotation angle
        angle = random.uniform(-self.max_rotate, self.max_rotate)

        out = []
        for img in pil_frames:
            # crop
            img2 = F.crop(img, i, j, h, w)
            # flip
            if do_flip:
                img2 = F.hflip(img2)
            # rotate around center
            img2 = F.rotate(img2, angle, resample=Image.BILINEAR)
            # to tensor + normalize
            t   = F.to_tensor(img2)
            t   = F.normalize(t, [self.mean], [self.std])
            out.append(t)
        # stack into C×T×H×W or T×C×H×W however you like
        return torch.stack(out, dim=0)  # (T, 1, H, W)

# usage in your Dataset:
train_transform = VideoAugmentations()
val_transform   = VideoAugmentations(p_flip=0.0, max_rotate=0.0)  # just crop+normalize

class VideoDataset(...):
    def __getitem__(...):
        pil_frames = load_pil_sequence(...)  # list of PIL.Image in ‘L’ mode
        if self.train:
            frames = train_transform(pil_frames)
        else:
            frames = val_transform(pil_frames)
        # then permute to (1, T, H, W) or (T, C, H, W) → your encoder
        return frames.permute(1, 0, 2, 3), ...
Tensor‑based / Kornia‑style
First stack your frames into a tensor of shape (B,T,C,H,W) or (T,C,H,W) and then use a library like kornia which can apply batch and sequential spatial transformations using a single sampled random parameter set:

import kornia.augmentation as K

# define once (randomly sampled parameters will be reused for each frame in the batch)
video_augs = nn.Sequential(
    K.RandomCrop((88,88)),
    K.RandomHorizontalFlip(p=0.5),
    K.RandomRotation(5.0),
    K.RandomErasing(0.3, scale=(0.02,0.15), ratio=(0.3,3.3), value='random'),
)

# in your Dataset __getitem__:
# 1) load & stack grayscale PIL frames → tensor [T,1,H,W]
# 2) video = video.permute(1,0,2,3).unsqueeze(0)  # [1, T, C, H, W]
# 3) augmented = video_augs(video)              # same crop/flip/rotate on all T frames
# 4) normalized = (augmented - MEAN)/STD
—

Both of these approaches guarantee temporal consistency of your spatial transforms across a clip. If you simply wrap torchvision’s Compose and call it per frame, each frame will get its own random crop/flip/rotate and your mouth ROI will look like it’s dancing around.

haz
continue, I need something's missing in the code assertions or something?

Below is a drop‑in replacement for your frame‐level transforms.Compose that:

Wraps all of your spatio‐temporal (crop/flip/rotate) ops into a single call so that the same random parameters get applied to every frame in the clip, and
Includes a few assert statements (and an example unit test) so you can immediately catch shape/magnitude mismatches.

Finally, a tiny pytest‐style snippet to verify that your augmentation is actually consistent across frames:

def test_video_augment_consistency():
    import numpy as np
    # make 5 identical grey‐level frames
    pil_frames = [Image.fromarray((np.ones((96,96))*i).astype('uint8'), 'L')
                  for i in range(5)]
    aug = VideoAugmentations(
        crop_size=(88,88),
        p_flip=1.0,         # force a flip
        max_rotation=0.0,   # no rotate
        color_jitter=(0,0), # no brightness/contrast
        p_erasing=0.0       # no erasing
    )
    out = aug(pil_frames)  # (T,1,88,88)

    # because every input frame was a constant image of value=i,
    # even after crop+flip we should still be constant per‐frame
    # and the *differences* between frames must equal i–j
    diffs = out[:,0,:,:].agg(torch.ptp, dim=(1,2))  # peak to peak per frame
    # we expect differences between successive frames to be exactly 1/std
    # but more simply we assert monotonic increase
    assert torch.all(diffs[1:] > diffs[:-1]), "Augmentation scrambled temporal consistency"
With these in place:

No more “frame‐by‐frame” random seeds (you sample once per clip).
Shape & value assertions guard you against silent mis‐normalizations or shape flips.
A unit test ensures that your augmentations are truly temporally consistent.

Now I will edit my code what sequence of actions will I take

Here’s a concrete “edit‑your‑code” plan. At each step you can verify correctness before moving on:

Add imports
At the top of your notebook/script, bring in what you need:

import random
import torch
import torchvision.transforms.functional as F
from PIL import Image
Paste in the VideoAugmentations class
Right after your imports, define the class we wrote above (with crop/flip/rotate/jitter/erase + asserts). This replaces your old per‑frame transforms.Compose.

Instantiate your train/val augmenters
Somewhere before you create datasets, add:

train_vid_augs = VideoAugmentations(
    crop_size=(88,88),
    p_flip=0.5,
    max_rotation=5.0,
    color_jitter=(0.2,0.2),
    p_erasing=0.3
)
val_vid_augs = VideoAugmentations(
    crop_size=(88,88),
    p_flip=0.0,
    max_rotation=0.0,
    color_jitter=(0.0,0.0),
    p_erasing=0.0
)
Remove your old data_transforms Compose
Delete or comment out the block:

data_transforms = transforms.Compose([
   transforms.ToTensor(),
   transforms.Normalize(...),
])
Modify your VideoDataset
In __init__, add a train: bool flag. In __getitem__, replace

if self.transform:
    frames = [ self.transform(frame) for frame in frames ]
frames = torch.stack(frames)...
with something like:

# after you load list of PIL frames
if self.train:
    video = train_vid_augs(pil_frames)      # → (T,1,88,88)
else:
    video = val_vid_augs(pil_frames)        # → (T,1,88,88)
# permute to (C,T,H,W)
video = video.permute(1,0,2,3)             # (1,T,88,88)

# quick check
assert video.ndim==4 and video.shape[0]==1 and video.shape[2:]==(88,88)

return video, input_length, label, label_length
Update your dataset instantiation

train_dataset = VideoDataset(X_train, y_train, train=True)
val_dataset   = VideoDataset(X_val,   y_val,   train=False)
test_dataset  = VideoDataset(X_test,  y_test,  train=False)
Write a small consistency check
Before you fire up the full training loop, run:

# grab one clip
vid, in_len, lab, lab_len = train_dataset[0]
print("shape:", vid.shape)            # expect (1,T,88,88)
print("min/max:", vid.min(), vid.max())
And/or run the pytest snippet we gave earlier to confirm temporal consistency.

Re‑run your DataLoader + one training batch
Make sure no shape/NaN/Infs pop up. Check your memory_mask and encoder input shapes haven’t broken.

Proceed with full training
Once your augmentations are rock‑steady, kick off your epoch loop as before.

By following these steps you:

• Apply the same spatial warp to all frames
• Have asserts that catch shape/NaN errors immediately
• Verify temporal consistency with a small test clip

You should now have a bulletproof video augmentation pipeline for your lip‑reading model. Good luck!

ok, but I will use just random cropping and horizontal flipping (p=0.5) besides my normalization and rotations also can, But I don't know about congratulating and p_erasing so remove them for now. reresopnd
Also I will use a library from GitHub for this for simplicity and max efficiency, implementing it from scratch will significantly affect our code and/or training time I think

so currently you should use web search to find best library for this based on our case then use scraping or GitHub read file tools to fetch latest content to be able to import and use it correctly
